    <name>Ahead of time compilation (AOT) support</name>
    <description><![CDATA[
    <h1>Ahead of time compilation (AOT)</h1> is a feature of JDK 9+ platforms
    allowing compilation of Java classes and JARs to native libraries. Such
    library can be used with application to reduce startup time
    and CPU consumption comparing to JIT.

    <br />

    Tests shows that AOT can slightly reduce startup time (0-24%),
    and significantly reduces CPU and resources usage during application startup,
    as Just In Time (JIT) compilation and interpreter is less often used.

    <br />
    <h1>Usage</h1>
    The plugin supports only <i>Application</i> configuration and was tested on OSX.
    <br />
    In order to use AOT enable it on <b>AOT tab</b> in the Application Run Configuration.
    </br>
    To generate AOT library search for AOT action - this action will generate AOT
    for currently active run configuration.

    <h1>Todo</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>passing custom parameters to jaotc;</li>
        <li>stripping debug symbols from library;</li>
        <li>
            detecting changes to dependencies and displaying warnings,
            when AOT library should be re-generated.
        </li>
